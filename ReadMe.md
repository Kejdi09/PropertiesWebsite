# Property Company Website (Work in Progress)

**Status:** ⚠️ This project is currently a work in progress as part of my internship.

This repository contains the **front-end code** for a property/real estate company website. It includes:

- HTML pages for homepage, property listings, and contact page
- CSS styling for layout, colors, and responsiveness
- JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic effects

## Features (Implemented So Far)

- Responsive layout using CSS Grid/Flexbox
- Navigation menu
- Property listing cards with sample data
- Basic form validation on the contact page
- Smooth scrolling effects

## To Do / Future Work

- Improve mobile responsiveness
- Add dynamic filtering and sorting for property listings
- Implement additional interactive UI components (sliders, modals, etc.)

## Notes

- This is an **unfinished internship project**, focused only on front-end development.
- The code is primarily for learning, demonstration, and tracking progress.
- **Do not use in production**; some features are incomplete.
